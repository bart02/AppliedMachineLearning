# Applied Machine Learning Course

In this Github repository, two pre-trained object detection models, Faster RCNN and YOLOv8, were evaluated on a custom dataset, collected by me. 
I have used as pre-trained models to detect new objects to reduce the time and effort needed to train a model from scratch.

At the end I get these results: YOLOv8 performed better in detecting objects on video, while Faster RCNN was more confident in detecting objects with precise bounding boxes.
